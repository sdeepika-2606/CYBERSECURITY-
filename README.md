A self-learning cybersecurity repository focused on core security principles, real-world threat types, and attack vectors. This project reflects my continuous learning in cybersecurity and my interest in ethical hacking, network security, and defensive security practices.

🔐 About Me – Cybersecurity Professional 

I am a passionate and driven cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong interest in penetration testing, ethical hacking, and security analysis. Currently pursuing my engineering degree, I actively build hands-on skills through Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, TryHackMe labs, and real-world security simulations.

My technical interests include network security, web exploitation, cryptography, and vulnerability assessment. I enjoy breaking down complex security problems and continuously improving my skills through practical learning and research. I believe cybersecurity is not just about tools, but about mindset, ethics, and resilience.

I am eager to contribute to security-focused teams, learn from industry experts, and grow into a responsible cybersecurity professional dedicated to protecting digital systems.
